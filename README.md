# Two-Wheeler Marketplace Web Application

## Problem
Users face challenges in browsing, comparing, and managing the buying process for two-wheelers due to fragmented information and lack of an integrated platform.

---


## Approach
Our solution is a web application designed to simplify the two-wheeler buying process by providing an integrated platform for browsing, comparing, and managing purchases. The frontend is built with React.js to offer a dynamic and responsive user interface, while the backend uses Django REST Framework to handle scalable APIs and business logic. Data is stored in PostgreSQL/Supabase to ensure structured and efficient management. The frontend is deployed on Vercel, the backend on Render, and the database on Supabase, providing scalability and cost efficiency. To optimize performance, we implement caching with Redis, database indexing, and lazy loading on the client side. The system is modular, with features such as vehicle browsing, comparison tools, financial tools, test ride management, and dealer dashboards. Additionally, advanced functionalities like an AI chatbot and machine learning-based recommendations enhance personalization and user engagement.
